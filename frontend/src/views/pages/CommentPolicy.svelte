            Welcome to my website, one of blogs focused on my interests. We try
            our best to make sure that the discussions on our articles are the
            troll, spam and abuse free but we're not omnipresent. The comment
            section can be a great place for interaction with readers, writers
            and even for spawning stimulating conversation - it can be a great
            place for all of us! To ensure that you have a good time over here
            at eademir.dev, please make sure to stick to the following
            guidelines:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-6">
            <li>
                Be polite - don't be rude to anyone and respect others. If
                something you would say would get you bottled on the head
                offline, please don't say it here. Remember there is a person
                behind the screen and that your words affect people.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don't troll. We appreciate and welcome criticism towards writers
                here, but comments that add no value to the discussion or that
                are merely insulting would be deleted without exception.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spam? Goodbye. We understand that you may make thousands of
                dollars working from home, however, we are not interested.
                Please refrain from posting or we'll give you a hand and show
                both you and your post the door.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To put it in a simple sentence, our guidelines boil down to “Don't
            be a dick”. If you don't follow any of these guidelines, not only
            will our moderators remove the comment but we may also ban you from
            participating in the discussions.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you find any comments which violate our guidelines, please make
            sure to 'flag' or 'mark as spam' - our moderators highly appreciate
            your support!
        </p>
        <p>Happy commenting!</p>
